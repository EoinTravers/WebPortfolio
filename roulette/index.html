      <p>Hello.</p>
      <p>
        In this task, you're going to play a very simple casino game.<br>
        At the end of the game, you'll be paid $2 just for finishing,
        plus a bonus that depends on how many points you've.
      </p>
      <p>
        You start with 100 points, with each point being worth 0.5 cent of real money.
        On each round, you'll be shown a gamble,
        and you can either bet, and either win or lose points,
        or pass, and win or lose nothing.
        There will be 200 rounds in total.
      </p>
      <h3>Press [SPACE] (the spacebar) to go on.</h3>
    </div>

<!-- InstrB is done with JS -->

    <div id="instrC0" class="instructions">
      <h1>Wheel of Chance</h1>
      <p>
        The controls are simple.<br>
        On each round, press [SPACE] within 5 seconds if you want to to take the gamble ("bet").<br>
        Otherwise, don't press anything, and you will "pass", and not take the gamble, instead.
      </p>
      <h3>Press [SPACE] to go on.</h3>

    <div id="instrC1" class="instructions">
      <h1>Wheel of Chance</h1>
      <p>
        The controls are simple.<br>
        On each round, press [SPACE] within 5 seconds
        if you want to to "pass" and not take the gamble.<br>
        If you want to take the gamble ("bet"), don't press anything.
      </p>

    <div id="instrC2" class="instructions">
      <h1>Wheel of Chance</h1>
      <p>
        The controls are simple.<br>
        On each round, press the [RIGHT] arrow within 5 seconds
        if you want to take the gamble,
        or press the [LEFT] arrow if you want to "pass", and not take the gamble.<br>
        If you don't press anything before time runs out,
        you'll lose 20 points from your score. Don't do that.
      </p>
      <h3>Press [SPACE] to go on.</h3>

    <div id="instrD" class="instructions">
      <p>
        There are just two other things you need to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, you can pause the game by pressing [P].
        It will pause after the current round ends.
        There will also be a break every 20 rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, do not minimize the browser window or engage in
        another task while this game is running, unless it is paused.
        If you record more than five rounds where the browser window
        is not open and in focus, or pause the game for too long,
        you will not be paid for this HIT.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's try a few practice rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, each round lasts five seconds.
        On the practice rounds, the wheel will flash every second
        to show you how quickly the time is passing.
        This will not happen in the main task.
