            <h2>Visual Discrimination Task</h2>
            <p>
                In this task, you'll see a bunch of dots, floating
                randomly around the middle of the screen. On each
                trial, after a random period of time, the most of the
                dots will start to move in the same direction. Your
                task is to indicate whether these dots are moving to
                the left, or to the right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the dots begin to move, press <b>"f"</b> if you think they're moving to
                the left, and <b>"j"</b> if you think they're moving to the right.
                You'll recieve <span id="correct_points"></span> points if correct,
                but lose <span id="incorrect_points"></span> points if you're wrong.
                Please rest your left index finger over <b>"f"</b>
                and your right index finger over <b>"j"</b> throughout the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                The amount of time you have to wait for the dots to
                start moving in the same direction varies from trial
                to trial, and on some trials you'll have to wait a
                very long time. Whenever you want, you can skip the current trial,
                and start the next one, by pressing <b>"f"</b> and <b>"j"</b>
                at the same time. You'll recieve <span id="skip_points"></span> points
                every time you skip. Remember, you'll only be playing
                for 15 minutes, so skipping the trials with long wait
                times is a good way to win more points, and earn more
                money.
